    Date of Last Revision: April 27, 2016<br/>
Welcome, and thanks for using Kanwokanwo.com and/or other Kanwokanwo services and apps! When you use our products and services, you're agreeing to our terms, so please take a few minutes to read over the User Agreement below.
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
1.1. Agreement
You agree that by clicking “Join Now” “Join Kanwokanwo”, “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services (including Kanwokanwo, our related mobile apps, developer platforms, premium services, or any content or information provided as part of these services, collectively, “Services”), you are entering into a legally binding agreement (even if you are using our Services on behalf of an institution).
This “Agreement” includes this User Agreement and the Privacy Policy, and other terms that will be displayed to you at the time you first use certain features (such as starting a “Group,” downloading one of our software applications or purchasing advertisements or messages), as may be amended by Kanwokanwo from time to time. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do NOT click “Join Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services.
Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”. This Agreement applies to both.
<h2>2. Obligations</h2>
2.1. Service Eligibility
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you will only have one Kanwokanwo account, which must be in your real name; and (2) you are not already restricted by Kanwokanwo from using the Services.
2.2. Your Membership
As between you and others, your account belongs to you. You agree to: (1) try to choose a strong and secure password; (2) keep your password secure and confidential; (3) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections, groups) and (4) follow the law and the Dos and Don'ts below. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
2.3 Payment
If you purchase any of our paid Services (“Premium Services”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes. Failure to pay these fees may result in the termination of your subscription.
2.4. Notices and Service Messages
You agree that we may provide notices to you in the following ways: (1) a banner notice on the Service, or (2) an email sent to an address you provided, or (3) through other means including mobile number, telephone, or mail. You agree to keep your contact information up to date.
Please review your Kanwokanwo.com settings to control and limit what kind of messages you receive from us.
2.5. Messages and Sharing
Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, slide deck, video uploading, picture posting, messages and blogs. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members or, if public, by Visitors. Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., sharing to a group instead of your network, changing the default setting for content from public to a more restricted view, limiting your profile visibility, or not letting people know when you change your profile, make recommendations or follow institutions). Note that other activities, such as applying for an institution or sending messages, are by default private, only visible to the addressee(s).
We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.
<h2>3. Rights and Limits</h2>
3.1. Your License to Kanwokanwo
As between you and Kanwokanwo, you own the content and information that you submit or post to the Services and you are only granting Kanwokanwo the following non-exclusive license: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, and process, information and content that you provide through our Services, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
a.	You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
b.	We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of others (including sponsored content) to others without your separate consent.

d.	While we may edit and make formatting changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.
